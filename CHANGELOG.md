# 1.1

Added `hack-format`, a format command that can also act on regions.

Ensure that starting `hack-mode` cleans up any old text properties, or
buffers with incorrect highlighting stay incorrect after upgrading.

Fixed some highlighting bugs with code after comments that look like
XHP tags.

# 1.0

Initial release:

* Extensive syntax highlighting
* Indentation
* `hack-format` support
